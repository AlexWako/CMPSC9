''' Quick Sort
* Can improve running times to O(nlogn) in a typical case, but we'll see how this can also lead to O(n^2)
in a worst-case scenario
* Idea: Can sort a list by subdividing the list based on a PIVOT value
    * Place elements < PIVOT to the left-side of the list
    * Place elements > PIVOT to the right-side of the list
    * When sub list sizes == 1, the entire list is sorted

* How to partition the list into left / right sublists
    * Choose pivot (since elements are random, choose the 1st element [0])
    * Find an element in the left side (using leftmark index starting at the beginning of the list
    just past the pivot, that will move right) that's out of place (> pivot)
    * Find an element in the right side (using rightmark index starting at the end of the list, that 
    will move left) that's out of place (< pivot)
    * Swamp out of place elements with each other
        * We're putting them in the "correct" side of the list
    * Continue doing this until rightmark index < leftmark index    
        * In this case, swap pivot element with rightmark
        * We're putting the pivot element in the correct place

* Best-case running time is O(n log n)
    * In the best case, there are log n levels. Each level is O(n) when performing the partition step
* However, the worst case is O(n^2)
    * Consider the case where the list is already sorted (or in reverse order)
    * The sub lists arenâ€™t evenly divided for every recursive call
    * Quick Sort performance is dependent on the pivot value
    * Can try to improve the pivot choice by selecting random values and choosing the medium
    * Textbook describes the median of three approach
        * Choose first, middle, and last element. Choose the median of these values
        * But even then, there is no guarantee that these values are good pivot values, but it does 
        improve our chances that they are
* Note that Quicksort DOES NOT need extra space (unlike merge sort)

''' Trees Terminology
* Node - An element in the tree. May have an incoming edge and many outgoing edges.
* Edge - A connection between nodes (can be directional or bidirectional)
* Root - The top most node (node without any incoming edges)
* Path - The sequence of nodes from one node to a destination node along the tree
* Children - Nodes that have incoming edges from another node
* Parent - Contains outgoing edges to other child nodes
* Sibling - Nodes that have the same parent
* Subtree - A tree structure where the root of the tree is a child of a parent
* Leaf - A node without any outgoing edges
* Level - Number of edges from the root node to a destination node
* Height - Maximum level of the entire tree
